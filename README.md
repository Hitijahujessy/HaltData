# HaltData
Visualise data of juvenile criminal offenses from Dutch government data website.

## Description
HaltData is a group project for school that shows data of juvenile criminal offenses in the Netherlands over a span of a couple of years.

The assignment was for us to choose a subject on the website of the Dutch government that piqued our interest and visualise it's data using a programming language or a data-analyis tool of our choice. We ended up choosing criminality of males and females aged 12-18. As programming language we chose to use Python.

This was supposed to be a small project so we chose to keep the data simple. The user can choose to view three graphs: amount of offenses by males, by females and a comparison between the two, all shown on a year-to-year basis.

## Division of tasks
We divided the tasks into three areas:

- Application development

- Data gathering and filtering

- Data visualisation

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- Plotly

## How to use

### Step-by-step

1. Run ```main.py``` using the ```python3 main.py``` command, or by using your code editor of choice.
2. The app shows the "male graph" by default. Use the buttons above the graph to swith between the graphs.
3. Use the source link under the graph to go the page of the dataset that we used on the Dutch government data website.
