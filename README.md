# HaltData
Visualise data of juvenile criminal offenses from Dutch government data website.

## Description
HaltData is a group project for school that shows data of juvenile criminal offenses in the Netherlands over the span of a couple of years.

### The assignment
The assignment was for us to choose a subject on the website of the Dutch government's data register that piqued our interest and visualise it's data using a programming language or a data-analyis tool of our choice. We ended up choosing a dataset on criminal offenses committed by males and females aged 12-18. We chose to use Python as programming language.

This was supposed to be a small project so we chose to keep the data simple. The user is able to view a graph that, by default, shows the amount of criminal offenses committed by males on a year-to-year basis. Data on the amount of offenses commited by females or the total amount of offenses per year can be toggled on/off as well.

## Division of tasks
We divided the tasks into three areas:

- Application development

    - @Hitijahujessy
- Data gathering and filtering
    - @JustinKerssies
    - @marnixnieswaag
- Data visualisation
    - @RixgamesGH
    - @JustinKerssies

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- TKinter
- MatPlotLib
- PIL

## How to use

### Step-by-step

1. Run ```main.py``` using the ```python3 main.py``` command, or by using your code editor of choice.
2. When the app opens, it shows the "male data" by default. Use the buttons above the graph to toggle between male/female/total offenses.
     - Multiple categories can be toggled on at once.
4. Use the source link under the graph to go the page that contains the complete dataset.
